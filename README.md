🎮 Tic Tac Toe - AI vs You
A fun and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with 💖 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my high school days (Class 12, 2023). This project started as a passion for learning how games work, and turned into a fully functional AI-based game with a beautiful UI — all made from scratch with the help of books 📚, online resources 🌐, and lots of trial and error.

Now it lives here on GitHub for everyone to enjoy and learn from!

🚀 Features
✨ Clean and modern UI with gradient background

🧠 AI that plays against you (never lets you win easily 😏)

🔁 Reset button to play again anytime

👥 Option to switch to two-player mode

🧠 Turn-based logic with win detection and messaging

🔷 Fully responsive and works smoothly in the browser

🕹️ How to Play
Start the game — it’s your move first!

Choose a cell to place your X.

The AI responds with its O.

Keep playing until someone wins or it’s a draw.

Hit Restart Game to go again.

You can also switch to Two Player Mode at the top right!

🧠 AI Logic
The AI follows simple but effective logic to block your moves and try to win when possible. It's not unbeatable, but it will give you a challenge!
