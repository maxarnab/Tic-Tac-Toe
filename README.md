# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - AI vs You

A fun and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built with 💖 using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** during my high school days (Class 12, 2023). This project started as a passion for learning how games work, and turned into a fully functional AI-based game with a beautiful UI — all made from scratch with the help of books 📚, online resources 🌐, and lots of trial and error.

Now it lives here on GitHub for everyone to enjoy and learn from!

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Clean and modern UI with gradient background
- 🧠 AI that plays against you (never lets you win easily 😏)
- 🔁 Reset button to play again anytime
- 👥 Option to switch to two-player mode
- 🧠 Turn-based logic with win detection and messaging
- 🔷 Fully responsive and works smoothly in the browser

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Start the game — it’s your move first!
2. Choose a cell to place your `X`.
3. The AI responds with its `O`.
4. Keep playing until someone wins or it’s a draw.
5. Hit **Restart Game** to play again.
6. You can also switch to **Two Player Mode** at the top right!

## 🧠 AI Logic

The AI follows simple but effective logic to block your moves and try to win when possible. It's not unbeatable, but it will give you a challenge!

## 🙌 Inspiration

This was built as a high school project in 2023 while I was in **Class 12**, with help from books, online tutorials, and pure curiosity. It's a small project, but it taught me a lot about game logic, DOM manipulation, and how satisfying it is to bring an idea to life.
